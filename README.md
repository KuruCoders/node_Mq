This 📁repository was 🏗️created with the goal of attaining a foundational understanding of 🚀microservices architecture using NodeJs with RabbitMq (an opensource message Broker). This encompassess basic microservices. The 🖼️above diagram vividly illustrates the distributed nature of the architecture. Communication among services is seamlessly established through the RabbitMq, fostering a dynamic and interconnected system.
